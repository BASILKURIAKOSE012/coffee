      <h2>Is Coffee Good For Health?</h2>
      <img id="m1" src="./images/coffee intro new.jpg" alt="">
      <p id="p1"> &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Coffee</strong> is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain
        flowering plants in the Coffea genus. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw
        product: unroasted green coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable
        product: roasted coffee, which is ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before
        being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.

        Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its
        caffeine content. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world and can be prepared and presented in a
        variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caff√® latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). It is usually
        served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream are often used to
        lessen the bitter taste or enhance the flavor. It may be served with coffee cake or another sweet dessert, like
        doughnuts. A commercial establishment that sells prepared coffee beverages is known as a coffeehouse or coffee
        shop (not to be confused with Dutch coffeeshops selling cannabis).

      <div id="a52">
       <br><p style="display: inline;"><strong>Espresso</strong>
          The espresso, also known as a short black, is approximately 1 oz. of highly concentrated coffee. Although simple
          in appearance, it can be difficult to master.
  
          Ratio: 1 shot of espresso
          Cup: 2-4 oz. Espresso Cup</p>

      <div id="a54">
       <br><p id="p8" style="display: inline;"><strong>Americano</strong> 
        Americanos are popular breakfast drinks and thought to have originated during World War II. Soldiers would add water to their coffee to extend their rations farther. The water dilutes the espresso while still maintaining a high level of caffeine.
          Ratio: 1 shot of espresso
          Cup: 2-4 oz. Espresso Cup</p>
       </div>

      <div id="a56">
       <br><p style="display: inline;"><strong>Long Black</strong>
        The long black is a similar coffee drink to the americano, but it originated in New Zealand and Australia. It generally has more crema than an americano.

        Ratio: 2 shots of espresso + 3 oz. of hot water
        Cup: 6-8 oz. Glass Coffee Mug

        Ratio: 2 shots of espresso
        Cup: 3-4 oz. Demitasse Cup</p>
